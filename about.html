                    <h3>Who I Am</h3>
                    <p>
                        Iâ€™m Eunice Nzilani, a dedicated computer science student passionate about mobile development, machine learning, and full-stack web development. My academic journey has been a mix of building technical expertise in programming languages like Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while also exploring innovative applications in mobile app development and machine learning. I have worked on several projects, including a mentorship platform designed to empower women in tech, and I am in the process of developing a skincare analysis app using machine learning to detect skin issues through a phone camera. My skills extend beyond just coding; I am also committed to creating user-friendly experiences, which is why I am keen on UI/UX design. Along with technical abilities, I possess strong leadership and mentoring experience, having started a career mentorship club during my high school years. Ultimately, I aim to leverage my skills in both tech and leadership to contribute to organizations that focus on growth, innovation, and empowering individuals.
